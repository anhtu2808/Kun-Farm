# Kun Farm Unity Project

This repository is prepared for a Unity 2D farming game. Follow the steps below to initialize the project locally.

## Requirements
- **Unity Hub**: Install Unity Hub from [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download).
- **Unity Editor**: Use Unity Hub to install a supported Unity Editor version (2020 or newer recommended).

## Steps to create the project
1. Open Unity Hub and click **New Project**.
2. Choose the **2D** template and select your desired Unity version.
3. Set the project location to the cloned repository folder.
4. Name the project, for example `KunFarm`.
5. Click **Create**.

Unity will generate the typical folders (e.g., `Assets`, `Packages`, `ProjectSettings`). The included `.gitignore` already excludes generated files.

After creating the project, commit the generated files except those ignored by `.gitignore`.

## Folder Structure
- `Assets/` - Your game assets and scripts.
- `Packages/` - Package information managed by Unity.
- `ProjectSettings/` - Project configuration files.

## Additional Tips
- Use version control by committing your work regularly.
- Consider adding a README in Vietnamese if needed.
- Add necessary packages via the Unity Package Manager (e.g., 2D extras).
